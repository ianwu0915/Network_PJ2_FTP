# FtpClient README

## Overview

FtpClient is a Python-based command-line FTP client designed to interact with FTP servers for basic file operations.

## High-Level Approach

The development of FtpClient involved several key steps:

1. **Socket Programming**: Utilized Python's `socket` library for establishing and managing TCP connections necessary for FTP communication.

2. **Command Line Interface**: Utilized `argparse` for parsing command-line arguments, allowing users to specify operations and file paths, including server or local path.

3. **FTP Operations**: Implemented essential FTP commands (`USER`, `PASS`, `TYPE`, `MODE`, `STRU`, `PASV`, `LIST`, `MKD`, `RMD`, `STOR`, `RETR`, `DELE`) to interact with FTP servers.

4. **Data Transfer Management**: Handled data transfer by using Control and Data channels for requesting and transferring files.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Handling FTP Responses**: Decoding and appropriately reacting to the variety of server responses was complex, particularly for multi-line replies.

2. **Data Channel Management**: Correctly implementing the PASV mode for data transfer proved challenging, requiring careful synchronization with the control channel.

3. **Error Handling**: Handling network issues or incorrect user inputs thorough exception handling and input validation.

## Testing

Testing was conducted in several stages:

1. **Unit Testing**: Each function for ftp commands was tested for expected behavior using various input scenarios.

2. **Integration Testing**: Tested the client's performance on a ftp.4700.network to ensure all commands interacted correctly with the server by printing out response from the server.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: Deliberately introduced erroneous inputs and network issues to verify stability and error handling.

## Conclusion

Developing the FtpClient was a valuable exercise in understanding network programming, specifically the FTP protocol.
